Project9:

First profile, variable offset GPR / Wide Angle Reflection Refraction (WARR)

Here you could in principle compute apparent slowness of EM wave in the soil by comnputing the slope t/distance
for the visible arrival phases. The wave velocity will be the inverse, distance/t

Here you should see the velocity of light from the air waves and at least one slower phase corresponding to the soil

Project 10:

Second profile, constant spacing GPR, reflection mode. 

Screenshots can be loosely interpreted as a "cross section" of the underground. You may see at least two layers here,
plus some hyperbolas corresponding to buried objects (stones, pipes,.... pirate treasure?!?!)

The layers are the ones that are interesting, try to correlate their depth with changes that you see in the  
resistivity data for the depth profile. 

Be aware that apparent depth is dependedent on the assume wave velocity -- here we assume that it is 0.1 m per 
nanosecond in the soil.

Project 12:

Third profile, constant spacing GPR, reflection mode. 

Same applies as for Project 12. But this is the other site on the dusty trail in the wooded area. 

The layers are the ones that are interesting, try to correlate their depth with changes that you see in the  
resistivity data for the depth profile.
